## Why batik co. ? 🔎
Our team noticed the growing problem in Batik UMKM where owners complain of their decreasing sale. After further investigation, we found out that the cause behind the decreasing sale of batik is that customers reject the product because they feel like the colors wa not up to their taste. This is where we come in, we decided to build an application that will allow Batik UMKM owners to scan the color of the customers want and through our application, it would give the combination values of RGB that is needed to create the designated color.
